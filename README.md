# AutoUpdaterVB.NET

AutoUpdaterVB.Net is a package that allows .Net developers to EASILY add auto update functionality to their software. This is a conversion to VB.Net of ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET which you can find on github. It is based on the .net framework version 4.0 or higher, consequently it works essentially the same as AutoUpdater.NET by ravibpatel. You can read the documentation at the ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET repository for details on how to make it work. I will try to add more information later.
